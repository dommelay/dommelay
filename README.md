### Full-Stack Software Engineer

## Hello and welcome to my GitHub!

Checkout one of my recent projects https://domsweatherapp.netlify.app/

I am a Full-Stack Software Engineer with a background in Biopsychology, Neuroscience, pre-med studies, and fashion modeling. My university course work has shaped me to be highly analytical and has helped me to develop excellent logic and reasoning skills. My modeling career has enhanced my sociability and networking skills, and serves as a source of creativity. I am driven by complexity, and have a passion for solving difficult problems and writing elegant code. I consider myself to be full-stack due to my knowledge and interest in the backend, but I prefer to stay in the frontend and act as a liaison. My favorite tool in my tech stack is React, and I love working with third party APIs.
