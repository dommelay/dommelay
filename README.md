### Full-Stack Software Engineer

## Hello and welcome to my GitHub!

My most recent project: https://domsgallery.netlify.app/

I am a Full-Stack Software Engineer with a background in Biopsychology, Neuroscience, pre-med studies, and fashion modeling. My university course work has shaped me to be highly analytical and has helped me to develop excellent logic and reasoning skills. I am driven by complexity, and have a passion for solving difficult problems and writing elegant code. My favorite tool in my tech stack is React, and I love working with third party APIs.
